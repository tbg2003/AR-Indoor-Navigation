# AR Indoor Office Navigation

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/j6H8EE4.png)
## Summary

The project aims to create a mobile app which helps the user navigate into the office easily with a click of a button.

### What to expect from our finalized product. 
In the final product we aim to provide an app in which admin users can upload routes from 
A to B. The users without admin access can then open the app and select a destination they 
wish to be directed to, via arrows displayed on the screen showing the phones camera view.
The admin user(s) will be able to add as many destinations and routes as they’d like which 
will all be stored for all non-admin users to access and navigate accordingly. The final 
product should incorporate the entire Defra Building allowing users to navigate to and from 
anywhere within the Defra workspace. 

### Destinations we aim to have in scope:
Offices, bathrooms, IT desk, Individual desks, printer/copier machines, water dispensers, 
smoking areas.
Using anchors and reference points enable us to display virtually rendered objects to appear 
and stay in place relative to the real world. Therefore, it should be possible to include most 
destinations which have enough feature points but objects without enough may be
excluded from the list of possible destinations.
### Out of scope destinations: 
Destinations which are currently out of scope include: charging ports and destinations which 
are not fixed to a specific location (actively changing locations).
Additional features such as accessibility options
A feature we aim to include in the final product would be an option for more accessible 
routes, allowing different routes to the same destinations via a more accessible route. For 
example, allowing the selection of a route which utilizes an elevator rather than stairs. 
Another accessibility option which we aim to include in the final version is the option for a 
colour blind friendly user interface, in which users with colour blindness can select an option

## User Stories

### MVP
  - As an office worker, I want a mobile app so that I can take it around the office with me
  - As an office worker, I want to navigate through the office with ease.
  - As an admin, I want to create paths to destination.

  - As an admin, I want paths to be saved to a database for other users to use.
  - As a developer, I want to ensure that only certain people have access to admin and user.
### Final Version
  - As an office worker, I’d like to use the navigation app in order to find my way around an unfamiliar office space without getting lost.
  - As an admin, I’d like the option to create, edit and delete routes if and when necessary.
  - As an developer, I'd like to update the app based on real feedback from cilents.
